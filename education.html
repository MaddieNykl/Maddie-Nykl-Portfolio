                <h2>My time at Dalhousie and beyond</h2> 
                <p>I’m wrapping up my degree in Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University, where I’ve taken courses ranging from software development to database systems and user experience design. My 4.15 GPA reflects the effort I’ve put into balancing theory with hands-on projects.</p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I’ve been part of the Women in Technology Society (WiTS) since my second year, contributing to a community that uplifts women in tech. I’ve also worked as a Teaching Assistant and marker, where I enjoy breaking down tough concepts for students—and keeping my own skills sharp in the process.</p>
                <p>Before university, I attended Templeton Secondary School in the enriched Math, Science, English, and Social Studies mini school program. I was also part of the Youth Outdoor Education (YOE) program, where we went on backpacking trips that really sparked my love for the outdoors. I was also involved in the theater program, contributing to hair and makeup, set design, writing, and acting—it was a creative outlet that balanced my academic pursuits.</p> 
                <p>Feel free to browse some select courses I’ve taken throughout my degree. Note that all the course blurbs are taken from the Dalhousie Academic Calendar (all website references can be found in the readme file on github).</p>

            <h3>CSCI 3101: Social, Ethical and Professional Issues in Computer Science</h3>
            <p>Computers can enable people to do things that our present laws and policies were not formulated to cover (hacking, sharing files on the internet, and companies sharing data). In such cases, people need to be able to decide for themselves the best course of action and defend such decisions. This course aims at developing the ethical reasoning skills and sensitivities that computer professionals will need to make good decisions and to justify them. The course includes a general introduction to ethical theories and their use in making and justifying decisions. We then consider various issues and case studies, illustrating the kinds of problems that can arise from the use and misuse of computers and technology: the responsibilities of computing professionals; ethics on the internet (hacking, computer crime, netiquette); privacy and information; intellectual property; social and political issues (digital divide, computers and work, the internet as a democratic technology).</p>
