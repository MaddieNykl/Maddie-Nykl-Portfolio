                <h2>Data Analyst at Softlanding Solutions Inc</h2>
                <span class="date">January 2024 - May 2024</span>
                <p>For the final co-op of my degree, I joined Softlanding Solutions as a Data Analyst, my first tech job in Vancouver. The work was really rewarding— our data team consulted clients in the public health sector, including schools and hospitals across Canada, helping them transition their data infrastructure to the cloud. I helped different members of my team gather client requirements, designed data architecture diagrams using Visio, and created detailed documentation to streamline their systems. My role involved hands-on coding in Python, PySpark, and SparkSQL, as well as supporting cloud migration efforts within a Microsoft environment.</p>
                <p>Working from the Harbour Centre with sweeping views of Vancouver was such a bonus. I truly loved this co-op, as it not only polished my technical skills, introduced me to such a smart and supportive team, but also introduced me to the tech scene of the city.</p>

                <h2>Development Intern at Dash Hudson</h2>
                <span class="date">May 2023 - September 2023</span>
                <p>My first co-op was with Dash Hudson, a dynamic social media analytics company. Despite being based in Halifax, they allowed me to work remotely from Vancouver, even on Halifax time—which meant 5:30 am daily scrums! It was a unique challenge that turned me into a morning person that summer; beautiful sunrises were definitely a bonus. </p>
                <p>On the technical side, I contributed to time-sensitive features, working across both backend and frontend development. I wrote backend code in Python, helped modify APIs, and gained a better understanding of CI/CD pipelines and using Docker. On the frontend, I contributed using VueJS and gained experience with testing tools like PyTest, Jest, and Cypress. The mix of teamwork and independence gave me confidence in tackling full-stack projects and collaborating effectively in a remote setup.</p>

                <h2>Leacross Student Outreach Team Lead</h2>
                <span class="date">August 2023 - January 2024</span>
                <p>I was thrilled to be recruited for this role by the Dean of Academic Outreach herself after she saw me speak on a panel for Women in Technology Day. She felt I was the best fit to lead the Leacross Outreach Team, a responsibility I took on with pride.</p>
                <p>In this position, I led a team focused on inspiring high school students across Nova Scotia to explore computer science. I coordinated tasks, mentored team members, and consulted closely with the AO Dean to ensure our outreach efforts were impactful. Visiting schools to share my love for computer science and connect with young students was both fun and fulfilling—it’s not every day you get to spark someone else’s passion for tech.</p>

                <h2>Teaching Assistant and Marker at Dalhousie University</h2>
                <span class="date">September 2022 - December 2024</span>
                <p>I started working as a Teaching Assistant and Marker in my second year of university, and it’s been one of the most rewarding parts of my academic journey. Helping students during office hours, marking assignments and exams, and leading lab sessions allowed me to strengthen my own understanding of core concepts like logic, syntax, and coding principles.</p>
                <p>Being a marker has made code reviews feel second nature to me, and I love seeing students grow in their abilities. It’s great to give back to the community by helping others while keeping my own fundamentals sharp—it’s a win-win that has shaped my confidence and mentorship skills.</p>

                <span class="date">June 2022 - May 2023</span>
                <p>I’ve been an active member of the Women in Technology Society since my second year, serving as both Treasurer and Vice President External. WiTS has always been close to my heart because of the amazing community and the work they do to create a supportive environment for women in tech.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite contributions was designing WiTS merch—it’s neat to see my artwork worn around campus. As VP External, I liaised with external organizations and planned events to bring people together, and as Treasurer, I managed fundraising efforts and facilitated Society ratification. WiTS taught me how to lead with creativity and empathy while fostering inclusivity in the tech community.</p>
